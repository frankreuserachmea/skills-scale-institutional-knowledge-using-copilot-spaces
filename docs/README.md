# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management docs. This README provides a concise summary of our project management framework and easy links to the team's core process guides to help newcomers and cross-team contributors find guidance quickly.

## Project Management Processes: Overview

OctoAcme runs projects with an iterative, outcomes-focused approach that moves work from lightweight initiation through planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Core principles include:
- Customer-first value delivery and measurable outcomes
- Iterative, incremental releases using prioritized backlogs and shippable increments
- Clear ownership and role definitions (Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, QA, Stakeholders)
- Structured communication and transparent risk management
- Quality built-in via automated tests, security scans, and code reviews
- Continuous improvement through retrospectives and tracked action items

High-level lifecycle:
1. Initiation — validate problem and success metrics, align stakeholders, produce a Project One-pager.
2. Planning — break work into shippable items, estimate, define Definition of Done, identify dependencies and risks.
3. Execution — deliver increments using a project board and PR workflow, surface blockers and track progress.
4. Release — run pre-release checks, smoke tests, draft release notes, and follow rollback/incident playbooks as needed.
5. Retrospective & Continuous Improvement — capture learnings, create action items, and update processes.

## Key Workflows & Practices (short)
- Project board columns: Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done
- Pull request expectations: small, linked to issue and acceptance criteria, CI passing, and at least one approval
- Team rhythm: daily standups, weekly delivery sync, PM–PdM weekly alignment, end-of-sprint demos, milestone stakeholder updates
- Risk & communication: maintain a Risk Register, use weekly status templates, and follow escalation paths (Team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor)
- Quality assurance: unit/integration tests, e2e smoke tests for critical flows, security scanning in CI, and manual QA where required
